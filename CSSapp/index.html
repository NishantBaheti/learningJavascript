        Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve
        automatically through experience and by the use of data.It is seen as a
        part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a
        model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make
        predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
        Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications,
        such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or
        unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed
        tasks.
